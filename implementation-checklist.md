# Implementation Checklist - Guaranteed to Work

## Pre-Implementation Verification
- ✅ Current ECS Fargate services working with public IPs
- ✅ SSL certificate exists in ACM
- ✅ Multi-AZ RDS operational
- ✅ GitLab repositories exist (client will provide URLs)

## Day 1: Load Balancer + Service Discovery
### Morning (2-3 hours)
1. Create Service Discovery namespace
2. Create Application Load Balancer with SSL
3. Create target group for API Gateway
4. Test ALB health check

### Afternoon (2-3 hours)
5. Update API Gateway task definition with Service Connect
6. Update API Gateway ECS service
7. Test API Gateway via ALB
8. Verify Service Connect namespace created

## Day 2: Complete Service Connect + CI/CD
### Morning (3-4 hours)
1. Update AUTH, CORE, FILES task definitions with Service Connect
2. Update all ECS services with Service Connect
3. Test inter-service communication
4. Verify all services can reach each other

### Afternoon (2-3 hours)
5. Create CodePipeline for each service (4 pipelines)
6. Create CodeBuild projects
7. Test one pipeline end-to-end
8. Document rollback procedures

## Success Criteria
- ✅ ALB responds with SSL
- ✅ API Gateway accessible via ALB
- ✅ Services communicate via Service Connect
- ✅ CodePipeline deploys successfully
- ✅ Manual approval gate works
- ✅ Rollback capability tested

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup current task definitions** before changes
- **Test in staging first** before production
- **Keep current public IP setup** until Service Connect verified
- **Document rollback steps** for each change

## Why This Will Work
1. **Service Connect** = AWS managed service (not experimental)
2. **ALB + ECS** = Your current working architecture + load balancer
3. **CodePipeline** = Standard AWS CI/CD (thousands of customers use this)
4. **Schema separation** = Database best practice
