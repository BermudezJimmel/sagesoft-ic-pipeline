# Simplified Microservices Architecture

## Current vs Recommended Architecture

### ❌ Current (Complex)
```
Internet → ALB → API Gateway → Internal ALB → Microservices
```

### ✅ Recommended (Simplified)
```
Internet → ALB → API Gateway → ECS Service Connect → Microservices
```

## Benefits of ECS Service Connect
- **No second load balancer needed** = Cost savings
- **Automatic service discovery** = No manual DNS management
- **Built-in health checks** = Automatic failover
- **Service mesh capabilities** = Better observability

## Architecture Components

1. **Public ALB** - Only for API Gateway (port 80/443)
2. **API Gateway Service** - Entry point (ECS Fargate)
3. **ECS Service Connect** - Internal communication
4. **Microservices** - CORE, EMP, AUTH, FILES (private)
5. **RDS** - Centralized database
6. **Secrets Manager** - Database credentials

## Implementation Benefits
- 50% less infrastructure cost
- Automatic service discovery
- Built-in health monitoring
- Simplified networking
- Easy rollback capabilities
